I'm a PhD researcher working in AI at Ulster University, focusing on Federated Learning (FL). I previoulsy worked as an electronics engineer, working in the development of tyre pressure sensors, for the automotive industry.

My current research is related to the development of a trustworthy federated learning system, and you can find my first published paper in the selected publications section below. I also have an interest in quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
