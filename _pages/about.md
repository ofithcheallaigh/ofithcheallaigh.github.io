<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I'm a PhD researcher working in AI at Ulster University, focusing on Federated Learning (FL). I previoulsy worked as an electronics engineer, working in the development of tyre pressure sensors, for the automotive industry.

My current research is related to the development of a trustworthy federated learning system, and you can find my first published paper in the selected publications section below. I also have an interest in quantum computing and quantum machine learning.
