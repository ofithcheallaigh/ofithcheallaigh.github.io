And that seems to be the case with the <a href="https://docs.fastf1.dev/index.html">Fast F1</a> dataset. This thing will give you lap times, car telemetry, weather data, tyre data, and not just for the race, for the practice session, and the qualification races too. It will even give you information on a team colour!</p> <p>So yes, a large amount of data. I find that when I have a dataset that is huge, I need to play around with it, dig into it to see what I can find, to see how I can use it. And that is what I have been doing over the last few days, on-and-off.</p> <p>The first thing I wanted to do was a bit of a comparison between the same race in different years. No real reason for picking this, but, it seemed like a good place to start,so I picked the race in Australia for 2025, 2024 and 2023. I picked this race because we are not that far into the 2025 season, and the Australian race this year was quite notable.</p> <p>In 2024 and 2023, the Australian race was the third race in the calendar, but it was the first race in 2025.</p> <p>Before we can start to analyse any data, we need to set that data. With the Fast F1 api, you need to get the session data, and then you need to load that data into a cache folder (which you create yourself). You can get the session data as follows:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">australia_2025</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fastf1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_session</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2025</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Australia</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">R</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

So, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code> for the 2023 and 2024 races, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> for the 2024 race. The final paramater I am passing in is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'R'</code>, for race. If you wanted qualifying data, you could pass in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'Q'</code>.</p> <p>Once you are all set, you need to load the data, as follows:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">australia_2025</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">load</span><span class="p">()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>And then you are set.</p> <h2 id="the-fastest-lap">The fastest Lap</h2> <p>The fastest lap is quite an obvious, and interesting place to start. With the Fast F1 api you can access the fastest lap time, sure, but you can also access the lap speeds, allowing you to plot the profiles.</p> <p>To get the fastest lap, we can do the following:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">australia_2025_fLap</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">australia_2025</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">laps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">pick_fastest</span><span class="p">()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>And basically repeat this for each year we are interested in. With a bit more work to get the speed data from the car, we can get the fastest laps for the last three races in Australia:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Blog/aust_fastest_lap.png" alt="Fastest Lap Plot"/></p> <p>From the graph:</p> <ul> <li>NOR: Lando Norris, McLaren driver</li> <li>LER: Charles Leclerc, Ferrari driver</li> <li>PER: Sergio Pérez, Red Bull driver</li> </ul> <p>You will have to excuse the fact that the timings still have “0 days”, I will figure out how to remove that later on.</p> <p>There are a few interesting things about this plot:</p> <ol> <li>I would have expected Max Verstappen to have had the fastest lap either in 2023 or 2024, given he was world champion in 2023 and 2024. But then, you will wear your tyres down pushing so hard, and maybe e did not need to do that.</li> <li>Why is there a 2-3 second difference between the 2023 and 2024 races when compared to the 2025 race, and is this a significant amount of time?</li> <li>Can we understand why Leclerc, in 2024, was hitting such high speeds in the mid-section? Was this typical of all drivers in that race?</li> </ol> <p>Some of these questions will be examined here, some will be looked at later.</p> <h2 id="what-happened-in-2025">What happened in 2025?</h2> <p>So why did Norris have the fastest lap in 2025, yet was about 2 seconds slower than the 2023 and 2024 races. One thing that can have a big impact on lap times is the track conditions – if there is something that can impact a drivers ability to put the car where they want in the track, they will have to be a bit more careful. One thing the Fast F1 api lets us look at is the weather conditions, so we can see if it was raining in all three years of the race we are looking at. Once you have the session data loaded. you can get the weather data quite easily:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">weather_data_2025</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">australia_2025</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">weather_data</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p><img src="/assets/img/Blog/rainfall_weather_data_2023_2024_2025.png" alt="Rainfall"/></p> <p>The Australian GP is 58 laps, so we can see from this plot that in 2025, there was rain for each lap of the race. It is important to note, that this will not mean every part of the track experienced rain for every minute of the race, more that there was rain on some part of the track across the race. Meanwhile, for 2023 and 2024, there was no rain during the race.</p> <p>Okay, so rain will have played a factor in a slower race, but with a time delta of about 2 seconds? That doesn’t seem like an awful lot. And to people who experience normal, everyday traffic, it isn’t. But, is it a lot in terms of F1?</p> <p>To answer this, I think looking at qualifying will give us some insights. The purpose of qualifying is to go the fastest over a single lap, with the objective of being on pole position. Or, getting as good a place on the grid as you can.</p> <p>So, a single lap, as fast as you can. Similar to the fastest lap during the race. To get this data, we need to gather the qualifying dataset:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">australia_2025_q</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fastf1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">get_session</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2025</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">"</span><span class="s">Australia</span><span class="sh">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="sh">'</span><span class="s">Q</span><span class="sh">'</span><span class="p">)</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>I got the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Q3</code> results as this is the qualifying phase that determines the positions of the top 10 drivers. Qualification happens on the Saturday, the day before the race, so, different weather conditions.</p> <p>After working with the data a bit, I was able to plot the results. Here is the top 3 qualifiers for 2025:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Blog/australia_q3_2025.png" alt="Q3_2025"/></p> <p>Here we can see that Norris (McLaren) was quickest, followed by Piastri (McLaren), then Verstappen (Red Bull). If we note the time on the y-axis, we can that there is less that 0.4 seconds between the three drivers.</p> <p>Looking at 2024:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Blog/australia_q3_2024.png" alt="Q3_2024"/></p> <p>A similar situation in terms of the time between the three drivers (i.e. &lt; 0.4 seconds), with Verstappen (Red Bull) being quickest, followed by Sainz (Ferrari), then Pérez (Red Bull).</p> <p>And finally, 2023:</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/Blog/australia_q3_2023.png" alt="Q3_2023"/></p> <p>Here, we see again, Verstappen (Red Bull) is the quickest, followed by Russel (Mercedes) and then Hamilton (Mercedes). Again, the time between the top three is about 0.4 seconds.</p> <p>And this makes a bit of sense for a number of reasons. One, the teams will prepare their car for the best qualification lap possible, with just the right amount of fuel, new tyres and so one. And, two, the regulations for the cars will have been quite stable during these races, with the last major regulation change coming between 2021 and 2022.</p> <p>of course, qualifying and a fastest lap in the race are not strictly the same thing, some of the reasons why I have listed above, but it does server to show how consistent the drivers can be, and how close, in terms of time, they can be. So, I think it is fair to say that fastest lap in 2025 being about 2-3 seconds slower than previous years is significant, expecially when you consider these cars can hit speeds in the region of 300kph (~185mph).</p> <h1 id="where-am-i-going-with-this">Where am I going with this?</h1> <p>My plan here is to see if I can build a machine learning model that can be used to predict the race winners. To do this, I will really need to dig into the data, and understand what I am looking at, determine which features are best used in a predictive model and so on.</p> <p>I plan to do a series of blog posts detailing this work, and then, post predictions ahead of the the next race (whenever that may be – this is a distraction project for me!).</p> <p>I will also include the project in the Projects section of this website, and link to the code in GitHub, at the appropriate juncture.</p> <p>So, yes.

This knowledge is used to provide context to the data.</p> <p>It is important to understand that there is a distinction between the ‘graph’ of knowledge graphs, and a chart, such as you would see when plotting time-series data, for example. A graph is a simple structure where we used nodes (or vertices) connected by relationships (or edges) to create high-fidelity models of a domain <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p> <p>The image below is of a representation of a KG:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/simple_kg-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/simple_kg-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/simple_kg-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/simple_kg.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="50%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> KG Image [[1]](#ref1). </div> <p>These graphs can be referred to an networks – they are a powerful way to describe how things are connected.</p> <p>Some graph models, like the <em>property graph</em>, allow for both nodes and relationships to contain <em>properties</em>. A property graph consists objects or vertices, and a set of arrows or edges, connecting the objects. Vertices and edges can have multiple properties, which are represented as key-value pairs <a name="ref2">[2]</a>. An example of this kind of structure can be seen if we think about a bank, where the customer accounts can be the vertices, and the transfers between accounts can be the relationships. The data in a graph can be analysed using the connections and relationships between them. Graph analytics, such as PageRank can be used to measure the relative importance of the data, based on the relationships between them.</p> <h2 id="property-graphs">Property Graphs</h2> <p>As stated, a property graph consists of a set of objects, or vertices, and a set of arrows, or edges, connecting the objects.</p> <p>Each vertex has a unique identifier and can have:</p> <ol> <li>A set of outgoing edges.</li> <li>A set of incoming edges.</li> <li>A collection of properties.</li> </ol> <p>Each edge has a unique identifier and can have:</p> <ol> <li>An outgoing vertex.</li> <li>An incoming vertex.</li> <li>A text label that describes the relationship between the two vertices it connects.</li> <li>A number of properties.</li> </ol> <p>The figure below illustrates this relationship in a simple property graph which contains two vertices and one edge.</p> <div class="row mt-3 justify-content-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0 text-center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/property_graph_relationship-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/property_graph_relationship-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/property_graph_relationship-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/property_graph_relationship.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="90%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption text-center"> Image shows Property Graph relationships. </div> <p>In Fig <a href="#fig2">[2]</a> the vertices have identifiers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>.

Nodes can have zero or more labels, which declares the nodes purpose in the graph, such as representing customers or products.</li> <li><strong>Relationships</strong> represent how entities interrelate. Relationships have a type, such as “bought” or “liked”, and have a direction, for example going from one node to another, or back to the same node. Relationships can contain zero or more properties, which are key-value pairs<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> representing some characteristics of the link, such as timestamps or distance.

We can see that some nodes are labelled as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code>, which represents people, and others are labelled as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Place</code>, which represents places.</p> <p>As each node will have properties stored inside, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name: Rose</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gender: f</code>, which tells us the Rosa is a female person. We can also see that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Karl</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fred</code> have nodes with slightly different properties, and this is not a problem<sup><a href="#myfootnote2">2</a></sup>.</p> <p>We can see in Fig. <a href="#fig3">[3]</a> that the relations are deeper because they have a type, a direction and can have operational properties on them. We can see from the figure that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Person</code> with the property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">name: Rosa</code> has an outgoing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LIVES_IN</code> relationship with the property <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">since: 2020</code> to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Place</code> node with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">city: Berlin</code> property.</p> <p>In the property graph model, there are no limits to the number of nodes or the relationships that connect them. Some nodes are connected in dense, complicated ways, while others can be sparsely connected. The manner of connection is determined by the problem domain. Nodes can also have many properties, or few properties, or even, none at all. Some relationships can have lots of properties, and many have none at all.</p> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>Recently, there has been increased interest in KG, due, in part because graph technology has accelerated, and also because there is a strong demand to use, and make sense of the data companies and organisations have.</p> <p>Decision making needs to be quick, but organisations can be slow to react due to the lack of timely and accurate data. Historical data may lose its relevance as time moves forward, so organisations seek new ways to gather and learn from data. Organisations will seek ways to gather rapid insights and recommendations across their business, from customer experiences and product feedback, from patient experiences and outcomes. These insights will allow for new product innovations, heightened fraud detection, and automation. In short, <strong>we need contextualised data to generate data knowledge</strong>.</p> <h2 id="kg-definitions">KG Definitions</h2> <p>KGs are a specific type of graph, with an emphasis on contextual understanding, meaning they should not be confused with the type of graph used to display information. They are an way to describe real-world details (such as things, places, events) through a linked set of facts. This information is given in a way that is understandable by humans, and by machines. KGs use an operating principle to allow an operator (be that a person, or a computer) to reason about the data in the graph. This operating principle, or organising principle, provides an additional layer of data (metadata) that will add connected context, which can be used to support reasoning and knowledge discovery.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="footnotes">Footnotes</h2> <p><a name="myfootnote1">1</a>: A key-value pair (KVP) is a data structure that associates two related pieces of data, a key and a value. A key is a constant that defines the data set. For example, a key could be “gender” or “colour”. A value is a variable that belongs to the data set. For example, a value could be “male/female” or “green”.</p> <p><a name="myfootnote2">2</a>: If we wanted to make sure that all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">person</code> nodes have the same property keys, we can apply <em>constraints</em> to the label, ensuring those properties exist, are unique, etc.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><a name="ref1">[1]</a> <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/knowledge-graphs/9781098104863/ch01.html">Knowledge Graphs (Ch.1)</a> - Jesus Barrasa, Amy E.
